<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student of School of Artificial Intelligence in Nanjing University advised by Professor [Yu-Feng Li](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/liyf/), and a member of [LAMDA Group](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx), which is led by Professor [Zhi-Hua Zhou](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/). I received my B.Sc. degree from School of Big Data and Software Engineering in Chongqing University. In September 2025, I was admitted to pursue for a Ph.D. degree in Nanjing University without entrance examination.

My long-term goal is to build practical and robust AI systems in the real world.

My current research interests mainly include Machine Learning, Learnware and Efficient Fine-Tuning for LLMs.
